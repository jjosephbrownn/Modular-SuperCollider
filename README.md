# Adventures in modular synthesis with SuperCollider

This is an ongoing project exploring modular synthesis techniques in SuperCollider.  Some basic SC knowledge is required but not a huge amount - this is more about having some practical fun with bloops and bleeps.  

Pages will be added when I have time/can be bothered and will probably veer around randomly.  This is a learning experience for me too so get ready heady moments of mutual growth.

Tradition dictates that I include some comments on existing educational material.  There is some great stuff out there but I find a lot of the standard documentation eye-wateringly jargon-tacular and little in the way of focussed practice or technique.  I guess this is me trying to correct that slightly by focussing on a method of composition and sound-making rather than a HOW TO USE SC style of thing.

I am very much indebted to SC wizz and real-world friend [co34pt](https://github.com/theseanco/howto_co34pt_liveCode) and his marvellous SC GitHub.  This is a really good resource that digs into some extremely practical and fun techniques for making delicous sounds very quickly.  It got me started so check it out NOW.
